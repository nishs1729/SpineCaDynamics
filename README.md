Geometry: Spine (with relevant molecules), Shaft (with only Ca), Synaptic Cleft (with only one vesicle of glutamate)
Spine Molecules: NMDAR, VDCC, PMACA, NCX, Calbindin, Immobile CBP, Ca
Stimulation: Back propagating action potential, Glutamate release
Ca Influx: VDCC, NMDAR, PMCA and NCX leak
Ca Otflux: PMCA and NCX extrusion, Spine Neck to Shaft
Function of Model: To measure number of Ca molecules entering or exiting the spine through each mode and number of Ca molecules that bind to the buffers at every time step

**********************************

Delay in Release Pattern

Back propagating action potential (BAP) and glutamate release (GR) occur with varying time gaps: 
	Peak of the BAP is always at 0.011 s, GR varies between 0.001 s to 0.021 s with a 0.002 s interval in different trials 
	i.e. time gap between BAP and GR ranges between -10 ms to 10 ms
